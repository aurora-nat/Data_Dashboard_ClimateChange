# Udacity Portfolio Project:
 Building a Flask Application for Plotly visualizations on Heroku

## Objective:
 This project involves writing a flask application that runs bootstrap and plotly visualizations to make graphs for data found on the data.worldbank.org. 

    Project involves four data csv files involving World Developing Indicators for Climate Change. The data that was utilized was pre-selected for the top 6 GDP producing countries in the world: The United States, China, Germany, Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom. 
    1. The first graph involves tracking CO2 emmissions from year 1990+
    2. The second graph involves tracking total greenhouse emissions from year 1990+
    3. The third graph involves tracking the total amount of forested area from year 1990+
    4. The fourth graph involves tracking the population growth since year 1990 onward.

    The data dashboard for these representations are built utilizing Bootstrap and Plotly.

    Bootstrap was the chosen framework for CSS / Javascript implentation for its simplicity and ease of use for creating a clean layout. For more information: https://getbootstrap.com/

    The Plotly graphing libary was used to create interactive visualizations for our CSV files. 
    For chosen graphs, a simple Scatterplot was utilized. For more information: https://plotly.com/javascript/

    The original data dashboard project was built using Flask alone. But to allow visualizations to be viewed online, we have used Heroku to deploy the web application online. Heroku allows applications for many programming languages to be used, like Python, for more information: https://devcenter.heroku.com/
